New year, new look!! There you go, Rio terminal got a new logo/icon made by [Christian Rocha](https://x.com/meowgorithm).

The first logo was made by myself but lacked a chef touch that Christian masterfully gave to it!

You may have already noticed on MacOS that if you're using version 0.2.24, in the upcoming versions it will be patched to Linux, BSD and Microsoft Windows.

Ok, but what if I like the new logo but I am attached to the old logo? No worries, I am working on a Rio API for changing app icons via configuration and bult-in.

That's it for today folks :)
